    "# MRjob, Python's interface to Hadoop\n",
    "This notebook shows two well-known, simple examples of the way Python connects to Hadoop through `mrjob`. Of course mrjob is not Mister Job but stands for MapReduce job. MapReduce is a framework to handle very large datasets (order of magnitude in petabytes or more) in parallel and on nodes of computers. Originally introduced by Google, the open source Java implementation Hadoop is from Apache. MRjob is the Python interface to Hadoop.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "## MRjob in a nutshell\n",
    "MapReduce is about the simplest way you can break down a big job into little pieces. Basically, mappers read lines of input and spit out tuples of (key, value). Each key and all of its corresponding values are sent to a reducer. Per key the reducer performs some operation on the values. The mapper and reducer logic is all that must be written.\n",
    "![](data/MapReduce-Basics2.PNG)\n",
    "There is much more on this subject. See [CS109-2015 lecture 14](https://github.com/cs109/2015/blob/master/Lectures/14-Recommendations_MapReduce.pdf) and many other sources on the internet."
